- Open the Collab file on google collab and then run it on the gpu
- use img.py for getting the frames from the video
- use the labelImg for labelling the custom dataset i.e for the annotations
- for setting the labelImg we need python 3.8 use conda environment for setting the python 3.8
- save all the labels into images folder
- create a crash_car file and inside it create two files images and labels - inside this two create training and validation. Inside training and validation of both the images and labels paste the content of the images folder i.e image and its .txt file
- Upload the crash_car.zip extract into dataset
- create a data.yaml in it in the preferred path inside datasets/crash_course
- After 100 epochs get the best.pt model from the weights folder of the train folder
- download the best.pt and use it into main file.
